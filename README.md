This Project working alongside Blenheim Palace for my final year dissertation aims to use agent based modeling to simulate a days visitor flow at Blenheim Palace,
Using Footfall sensor data i created a virtual enviroment of the palace adding visitors as agents with their own unique behaviours and interactions with the palace,
As a result of this, my model at any point within the palaces open hours is on average 13.715 visitors higher or lower than the true value.
